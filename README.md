# BestPlaceCA
Homework10 for STAT547M

## About this project

***This project is one homework for [STAT547](http://stat545.com/index.html)***
***The build process is kind of slow because of some functions. Please wait for a while if you want to bulid*** 

I followed the tutorial of @ropensci and scraped some data about the Cost-of-Living and Job of Counties in California. I used some functions like read_html(), html_nodes() and html_attr() to get useful data without using API.

The website that I extracted is [bestplaces](https://www.bestplaces.net).
